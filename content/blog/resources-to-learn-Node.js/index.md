Here a collection of resources I used to learn Node.js

- [The Complete Node.js Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=LongTail_la.EN_cc.ROW&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_77879424134_._ad_428734577250_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-1007766171312_._li_2788_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=Cj0KCQjwybD0BRDyARIsACyS8msztzRh9239SLcRfqvPBS9qR6bG0NKHQx6oOgnmoAZ_392RTV1nKaoaAnlREALw_wcB) - **beginner**.

[Andrew Mead] is a great teacher so you are in safe hands.

You will learn to build, test and deploy real wold Node.js applications using Express, MongoDB and Jest.

- [Node JS: Advanced Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-node-for-developers/) - **intermediate**.

[Stephen Grider] is a master of Node.js but also a genius teacher that turns hard topics into digestible yet fun learning moments.

You will learn Node.js internals, speed up database queries with caching MongoDB queries backed by Redis, utilize Worker Threads and Clustering to dramatically improve the performance of Node servers and more.

I do not get paid if you buy any of the courses.
