In this post I give you a plan to learn JavaScript without much pain.

> First learning JavaScript is easy but mastering JavaScript takes time and practice so be patient.

At this point in time you want to learn JavaScript but your end goal is to learn **React** or **Node** or any other JavaScript based framework/library.

Here is my suggestion:

> Learn just the basics of JavaScript and then move on to learn the framework of you choice.

Whait what do you mean by the basics of JavaScript ?

Well I mean the followings:

- JavaScript data types
- JavaScript control flow (if statement, for loop)
- JavaScript array manipulation methods (map, filter, reduce)
- JavaScript Functions and Objects
- JavaScirpt variable scope resolution
- JavaScriopt exception handling (`try catch`)
- the concept of callback function
- the concept of a Promise

Use `Prettier` to beautifully format your code and `ESLint` to discover potential bugs before running your code, they are easy to setup.

Here is my plan

1. Learn the basics of JavaScript

   I suggest [JavaScript info](https://javascript.info/) and [freeecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

2. Learn the basics of your framework of choice (**Vue** or **Node**)

   Pick one framework and do not jump from one to the next, [**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/) is a great start.

3. Build a small web applications using your framework of choice

   Start small by just building applications with just one feature, show it to your friends and get suggestions to improve it.

4. Get feedback on your code from someone you trust that has significant experience in JavaScript or the Framework of you choice.

   I would be happy to help, dop me an email at moncef.bouallagui@gmail.com.

5. Pick up an advanced concept in JavaScript and learn more about it.

Some advanced JavaScript concepts:

- Closure
- `This` key word
- `Prototype` property and inheritance
- Iterators and iterator protocole
- Asynchronous iterators
- The concept of event loop

  Always remember

> Learning by doing, is the best way to really learn.
> Learning JavaScript is a journey so be patient, but never stop learning.
